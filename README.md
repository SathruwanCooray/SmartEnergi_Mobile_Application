# SmartEnergi

## Overview

SmartEnergi is a second-year group project developed by Group CS-100 at the IIT affiliated by the University of Westminster. It aims to develop a smart energy application to assist users in tracking their device energy consumption effectively. The project is divided into five main features, each assigned to a member of the group.

## Features

- **Live Energy Tracking (Completed)**:
  - Assigned to: Sathruwan
  
  Users can monitor their device energy consumption in real-time, providing immediate insights into usage patterns.

- **Energy Limit Notifications (Completed)**:
  - Assigned to: Sineth
  
  SmartEnergi sends push notifications to users when their energy consumption exceeds predefined limits, enabling them to take corrective actions promptly.

- **Night Time Activity Monitoring (Completed)**:
  - Assigned to: Induwara
  
  SmartEnergi monitors device activity after a given time set by the user and sends notifications if the device remains active during that period.

- **Machine Learning Component (In-Completed)**:
  - Assigned to: Ruvindu
  
  Utilizing machine learning algorithms, the application predicts future energy consumption based on historical data, empowering users to plan and manage their energy usage more effectively.

- **Comparison Graphs (In-Completed)**:
  - Assigned to: Vishwa
  
  The application offers graphical representations for comparing energy consumption over different time periods, allowing users to identify trends and make informed decisions.
